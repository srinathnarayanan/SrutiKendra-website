"The ultimate aim of spirituality is to make a man realise
that he is the indesctructible self, beyond the sea of changes",
advocates Svami Moksha Vidhyaananda Sarasvati, who takes 
pride in the Indian culture and her rich resource of 
knowledge, the Sruti or the vedas.
<br/>
<br/>
It was in 1992 that Swamiji fully immersed himself into the
pursuit of spirituality. In December 2011, Swamiji formed
Sruti Kendra with the main objective of reaching out to all
sections of society and to spread the sacred spiritual 
knowledge, with special focus on children and the youth, 
spreading the glory of our rich culture. He inspires the 
householders also to walk the path of dynamic karma yoga 
to identify and reach the highest goals of life.
<br/>
<br/>
An eloquent orator in Tamil, deep rooted in the Vedas, 
an erudite scholar, and ardent cricket fan, an inspiring 
and encouraging teacher, a humble disciple, an appreciator of the arts, a committed worker 
and overall, a good and simple human being, Svami Moksha Vidhyaananda Sarasvati is the 
quintessential modern day Swamiji and is perhaps the most interesting person one can meet.
